# Virtual Internship as Data Analytics Position at Quantium

I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to Quantium and Forage for the opportunity to complete the virtual internship program. This experience has been invaluable in deepening my understanding of the data analytics role and the skills required to succeed in this field.

I highly recommend this program to anyone interested in learning Python for data analysis. Prior to the internship, my Python knowledge was limited. However, through dedicated practice and the guidance provided, I have developed a strong foundation in Python programming. I am now proficient in using Jupyter Notebook, leveraging essential libraries and functions, and effectively designing presentations.

While working on the project, I encountered challenges related to code optimization and problem-solving techniques. These experiences have motivated me to continue my learning journey and strive for deeper expertise in data analytics.

I think I have successfully completed this project and earned a certificate. Should you have any inquiries or require additional information regarding this project, please feel free to reach out to me. I am available to provide any necessary assistance
