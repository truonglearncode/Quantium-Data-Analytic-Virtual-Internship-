**What I'll learn**
- Understand how to examine and clean transaction and customer data.
- Learn to identify customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
- Gain experience in creating charts and graphs to present data insights.
- Learn how to derive commercial recommendations from data analysis.

**What I'll do**
- Analyze transaction and customer data to identify trends and inconsistencies. 
- Develop metrics and examine sales drivers to gain insights into overall sales performance. 
- Create visualizations and prepare findings to formulate a clear recommendation for the client's strategy.
## Background Information <a class = 'anchor' id = 'background-info'></a>
You are part of Quantium’s retail analytics team and have been approached by your client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.

The insights from your analysis will feed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

*Main Tasks*

`Examine transaction data` – look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables.

`Examine customer data` – check for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and when you are happy merge the transaction and customer data together

`Data analysis and customer segments` – make sure you define the metrics – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights.

`Deep dive into customer segments`   – define your recommendation from your insights, determine which segments we should be targeting
## Task Information <a class = 'anchor' id = 'task-info'></a>
We need to present a strategic recommendation to Julia that is supported by data which she can then use for the upcoming category review. However, to do so, we need to analyse the data to understand the current `purchasing trends` and `behaviours`. The client is particularly interested in `customer segments` and their `chip purchasing behaviour`. Consider what metrics would help describe the customers’ purchasing behaviour.  

Begin performing high-level data checks such as:

- Creating and interpreting high-level summaries of the data
- Finding outliers and removing these (if applicable)
- Checking data formats and correcting (if applicable)

You will also want to derive extra features such as `pack size` and `brand name` from the data and define metrics of interest to enable you to draw insights on who spends on chips and what drives spends for each customer segment. Remember, our end goal is to form a strategy based on the findings to provide a clear recommendation to Julia the Category Manager so make sure your insights can have a commercial application.

`LIFESTAGE`: Customer attribute that identifies whether a customer has a family or not and what point in life they are at e.g. are their children in pre-school/primary/secondary school.

`PREMIUM_CUSTOMER`: Customer segmentation used to differentiate shoppers by the price point of products they buy and the types of products they buy. It is used to identify whether customers may spend more for quality or brand or whether they will purchase the cheapest options.
